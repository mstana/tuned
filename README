Tuned: Daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices.

(This is tuned 2.0 with a new code base. If you are looking for the older
version, please check out branch '1.0' in our Git repository.)

How to use it
-------------

In Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and their derivates install tuned package
(optionally tuned-utils, tuned-utils-systemtap, and tuned-profiles-compat):

# yum install tuned

After the installation, start the tuned service:

# systemctl start tuned

You might also want to run tuned whenever your machine starts:

# systemctl enable tuned

If the daemon is running you can easily control it using 'tuned-adm' command
line utility. This tool communicates with the daemon over DBus. Any user can
list the available profiles and see which one is active. But the profiles can
be switched only by root user or by any user with physical console allocated
on the machine (X11, physical tty, but no SSH).

To see the current active profile, run:

$ tuned-adm active

To list all available profiles, run:

$ tuned-adm list

To switch to a different profile, run:

# tuned-adm profile <profile-name>

And to disable all tunings, run:

# tuned-adm recommend
Recommend profile suitable for your system. Currently only static detection is
implemented - it decides according to data in /etc/system-release-cpe and
virt-what output. The rules for autodetection are defined in recommend.conf
in profile directory. They can be overriden by user by putting the
recommend.conf into /etc/tuned. The default rules recommends profiles targeted
to the best performance or balanced profile if unsure.

# tuned-adm off

Your profile choice is also written into /etc/tuned/active_profile and this
choice is used when the daemon is restarted (e.g. with the machine reboot).


Available tunings
-----------------

We are currenlty working on many new tuning features. Some are described in
the manual pages, some are yet undocumented.
