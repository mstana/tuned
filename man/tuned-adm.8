.TH TUNED_ADM "8" "28 Mar 2012" "Fedora Power Management SIG" "tuned"
.SH NAME
tuned-adm \- commandline tool for switching between different tuning profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tuned-adm 
.B 
.BR [ " list ", " active ", " profile <profile> ", " off " ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command line utility allows user to switch between user definable tuning
profiles. Several predefined profiles are already included. You can even
create your own profile, either based on one of the existing ones by copying
it or make a completely new one. The distribution provided profiles are stored
in subdirectories below /usr/lib/tuned and the user defined profiles in
subdirectories below /etc/tuned. If there are same profiles on both places,
user defined profiles have precedence.

The power saving profiles contain settings that are typically not enabled by
default as they will noticeably impact the latency/performance of your system
as opposed to the power saving mechanisms that are enabled by default. On the
other hand the performance profiles disable the additional power saving
mechanisms of tuned as they would negatively impact throughput or latency.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.SS
.TP
.B list
List all available profiles.

.TP
.B active
Show current active profile.

.TP
.B profile <profile>
Switches to the given profilename. If none is given or no valid one is given
the command gracefully exits without performing any operation.

.TP
.B recommend
Recommend profile suitable for your system. Currently only static detection is
implemented - it decides according to data in /etc/system-release-cpe and
virt-what output. The rules for autodetection are defined in recommend.conf in
profile directory. They can be overriden by user by putting the recommend.conf
into /etc/tuned. The default rules recommends profiles targeted to the best
performance or balanced profile if unsure.

.TP
.B off
Switch off tuned.

.SH PREDEFINED PROFILES
At the moment we're providing the following pre defined profiles:

.TP
.BI "balanced"
It is the default profile. It provides balanced power saving and performance.
At the moment it enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned and it makes sure the
ondemand governor is active (if supported by the current cpufreq driver). It
sets the CPU energy performance bias to normal. It also enables AC97 audio
power saving or (it depends on your system) HDA-Intel power savings with 10
seconds timeout. In case your system contains supported Radeon graphics card
(with enabled KMS) it configures it to automatic power saving.

.TP
.BI "powersave"
Maximal power saving, at the moment it enables USB autosuspend (in case
environment variable USB_AUTOSUSPEND is set to 1), enables ALPM power saving
for SATA host adapters, enables WiFi power saving, enables multi core power
savings scheduler for low wakeup systems and makes sure the ondemand governor
is active (if supported by the current cpufreq driver). It sets the CPU energy
performance bias to powersave. It also enables AC97 audio power saving or (it
depends on your system) HDA-Intel power savings (with 10 seconds timeout).
In case your system contains supported Radeon graphics card (with enabled KMS)
it configures it to automatic power saving. On Asus Eee PCs dynamic Super
Hybrid Engine is enabled.

.TP
.BI throughput-performance
Profile for typical throughput performance tuning. Disables power saving
mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that improve the throughput performance
of your disk and network IO. CPU governor is set to performance and CPU energy
performance bias is set to performance. Disk readahead values are increased.

.TP
.BI latency-performance
Profile for low latency performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms.
CPU governor is set to performance andlocked to the low C states (by PM QoS).
CPU energy performance bias to performance.

.TP
.BI network-throughput
Profile for throughput network tuning. It is based on the throughput-performance
profile. It additionaly increases kernel network buffers.

.TP
.BI network-latency
Profile for low latency network tuning. It is based on the latency-performance
profile. It additionaly disables transparent hugepages, NUMA balancing and
tunes several other network related sysctl parameters.

.TP
.BI "desktop"
Profile optimized for desktops based on balanced profile. It additionaly
enables scheduler autogroups for better response of interactive applications.

.TP
.BI "virtual-guest"
Profile optimized for virtual guests based on throughput-performance profile.
It additionally decreases virtual memory swappiness and increases dirty_ratio
settings.

.TP
.BI "virtual-host"
Profile optimized for virtual hosts based on throughput-performance profile.
It additionally enables more aggresive writeback of dirty pages.

.TP
.BI "sap"
Profile optimized for the best performance of SAP software. It is based on
throughput-performance profile. It additionally tunes sysctl settings
regarding shared memory, semaphores and maximum number of memory map
areas a process may have.

.SH PREDEFINED COMPAT PROFILES
We are also providing so called "compat" profiles that are here mostly for
backward compatibility with tuned 1.0. They are oriented to more specific
scenarios.

.TP
.BI "default"
It is the lowest of the available profiles in regard to power saving and only
enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned.

.TP
.BI "desktop-powersave"
A power saving profile directed at desktop systems. Enables ALPM power saving
for SATA host adapters as well as the CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of tuned.

.TP
.BI server-powersave
A power saving profile directed at server systems. Enables ALPM power saving
for SATA host adapters, and activates the CPU and disk plugins of tuned.

.TP
.BI laptop-ac-powersave
Medium power saving profile directed at laptops running on AC. Enables ALPM
power saving for SATA host adapters,  WiFi power saving as well as CPU,
ethernet and disk plugins of tuned.

.TP
.BI laptop-battery-powersave
Strong power saving profile directed at laptops running on battery. Currently
an alias to powersave profile.

.TP
.BI "spindown-disk"
Strong power saving profile directed at machines with classic HDDs. It enables
aggressive disk spin-down. Disk writeback values are increased and disk
swappiness is lowered. Log syncing is disabled. All partitions are remounted
with 'noatime' option. All tuned plugins are disabled.

.TP
.BI "enterprise-storage"
Server profile for high disk throughput performace tuning. Disables power
saving mechanisms and enables deadline IO scheduler. Enables hugepages and
disables disk barriers. Disk readahead values are increased. CPU governor is
set to performance.
