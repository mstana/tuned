varnetload \- tool to create reproducable network traffic
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvarnetload\fP [\fI-d delay\fP] [\fI-t time to run\fP] [\fI-u url\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvarnetload\fR is a simple python script to create reproducable sustained network traffic.

In order to use it effectively, you need to have an HTTP server present in your local LAN where you
can put files. Upload a large HTML (or any other kind of file) to the HTTP server. Use the -u option
of the script to point to that URL. Play with the delay option to vary the load put on your network.
