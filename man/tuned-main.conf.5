.SH NAME
tuned-main.conf \- Tuned global configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page documents format of the Tuned global configuration file.
The \fItuned-main.conf\fR file uses the ini-file format.

.TP
.BI dynamic_tuning= BOOL
This defines whether the dynamic tuning is enabled. It is boolean value.
It can be \fBTrue\fR or \fB1\fR if the dynamic tuning is enabled and
\fBFalse\fR or \fB0\fR if disabled. In such case only the static tuning
will be used. Please note if it is enabled here, it is still possible
to individually disable it in plugins.

.TP
.BI sleep_interval= INT
Tuned daemon is periodically waken after \fIINT\fR seconds and checks
for events. By default this is set to 1 second. If you have Python 2
interpreter with applied patch from Red Hat Bugzilla #917709 this
controls responsiveness time of Tuned to commands (i.e. if you
request profile switch, it may take up to 1 second until Tuned reacts).
Increase this number for higher responsiveness times and more power
savings (due to lower number of wakeups). In case you have unpatched
Python 2 interpreter, this settings will have no visible effect,
because the intepreter will poll 20 times per second.

.TP
.BI update_interval= INT
Update interval for dynamic tuning (in seconds). Tuned daemon is periodically
waken after \fIINT\fR seconds, updates its monitors, calculates new tuning
parameters for enabled plugins and applies the changes. Plugins that have
disabled dynamic tuning are not processed. By default the \fIINT\fR is set
to 10 seconds. Tuned daemon doesn't periodically wake if dynamic tuning is
globally disabled (see \fBdynamic_tuning\fR) or this setting set to 0.
This must be multiple of \fBsleep_interval\fR.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
dynamic_tuning = 1
sleep_interval = 1
update_interval = 10
